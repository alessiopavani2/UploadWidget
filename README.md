# UploadWidget

This little project of ours was made using Angular by following this tutorial: https://angular.dev/tutorials/learn-angular for the frontend of the app, and following this tutorial: https://blog.angular-university.io/angular-file-upload/ for the main functionalities of the app.

## What is it

This app is called UploadWidget and it consists of a simple Angular app that allows users to upload files to a server. The app has a simple UI that allows users to select a file, and upload the file to the server and eventually to even cancel the upload . The app also has a feature to display the progress of the upload. The app is built using Angular and uses the Angular CLI to create the project. The app uses the HttpClient to make HTTP requests to the server. The following command is used to start the app:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:
- To create a simple Angular app that allows users to upload files to a server.
- To learn how to build a fully functional Angular file upload component.
- To learn how to use the HttpClient to make HTTP requests to the server.




For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```


## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```


## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
